Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _21G.101 Chinese I (Regular)_ as it was taught by Haohsiang Liao in Fall 2014.

This subject is the first semester of four that forms an introduction to modern standard Chinese. The course presupposes no prior background in the language. The relationship between Chinese language and culture and the sociolinguistically appropriate use of language is stressed throughout the course. Typical class formats include performance of memorized basic conversations, drills, questions and discussion, and various types of communicative exercises.

{{< anchor "assessment" >}}{{< /anchor >}}

Assessment
----------

The students' grades were based on the following activities:

- 60% Daily classroom performance (including performance of basic conversations, participation in class activities, quizzes and/or homework)
- 5% Oral Report
- 25% Review Tests
- 10% Final Oral Interview

### Instructor Insights on Assessment
Grades in the course were largely determined by classroom performance. Among the numerous reasons for this emphasis, the main one is that we are convinced that if students follow the course with consistency and persistence, they will develop significant demonstrable skills in Chinese by the end of the semester.

Student Information
-------------------

![Approximately 40 students took this course in Fall 2014](BASEURL_PLACEHOLDER/resources/40-approx)

### Breakdown by Major

Variety of majors, typically including one or two graduate students from the MIT Sloan School of Management.

### Typical Student Background

MIT does not have a foreign language requirement. Students who take this course do so because they understand that learning a foreign language has value. Some take the course to fulfill a personal interest. Others are interested in participating in the [MIT-China Program](http://misti.mit.edu/student-programs/location/china) and want to develop their language skills in preparation for an internship or study abroad experience. Others are interested in majoring or minoring in Chinese.

### Enrollment Cap

There are four sections of the course, with enrollment in each section limited to 16 students.

### Rubric

_Daily performance on the activities assigned in the weekly schedule are graded based on the following four-point scale:_

| POINTS | DESCRIPTIONS |
| --- | --- |
| 4 | Performance that promises interaction with a native with no difficulty, discomfort, or misunderstanding; no English hesitation noises in speaking and no "foreignisms" in the written work. |
| 3.5 | Performance comprehensible to native speakers, but with some non-patterned errors that would hinder smooth interaction with them. |
| 3 | Performance comprehensible to a native, but with evident weakness or patterned errors. |
| 2.5 | Communication requires much help from interlocutor. |
| 2 | Performance puts burden on interlocutor. To facilitate communication, a Chinese-speaking native would probably avoid using Chinese with you. |
| 1.5 | Barely prepared; little competency evident. |
| 1 | Evidently unprepared; unable to perform. |
| 0 | Absent.
